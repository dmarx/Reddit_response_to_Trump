This project constructs the following [report](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmarx/Reddit_response_to_Trump/blob/master/The%20impact%20of%20significant%20events%20on%20Trump&apos;s%20approval%20ratings.ipynb). A detailed discussion of the methodology used to collect the data and construct the charts for that report can be found in this [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmarx/Reddit_response_to_Trump/blob/master/Reddit%20Response%20to%20US%20Political%20Turmoil.ipynb). This latter notebook actually builds the charts for the former, so to reproduce this analysis run the "methodology" notebook first and then run the "report" notebook.

NB: nbviewer caches rendered notebooks. It may be neessary to append `?flush_cache=true` to the URL to get the latest version of this notebook.

Although Github is normally able to render jupyter notebooks, it has issues with plotly charts (see discussion on [this issue](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/396) so if you don't want to run the notebook yourself, we need to use nbviewer to view it.

This project presumes you have configured a `praw.ini` file with the necessary credentials for accessing Reddit. Instructions for configuring praw.ini can be found here: http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html
