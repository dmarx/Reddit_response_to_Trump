[**View the notebook on nbviewer**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmarx/Reddit_response_to_Trump/blob/master/Reddit%20Response%20to%20US%20Political%20Turmoil.ipynb)

Or jump straight to the [final product](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmarx/Reddit_response_to_Trump/blob/master/Reddit%20Response%20to%20US%20Political%20Turmoil.ipynb#chart) (i.e. the bottom of the notebook).

Although Github is normally able to render jupyter notebooks, it has issues with plotly charts (see discussion on [this issue](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/396) so if you don't want to run the notebook yourself, we need to use nbviewer to view it.

This project presumes you have configured a `praw.ini` file with the necessary credentials for accessing Reddit. Instructions for configuring praw.ini can be found here: http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html
